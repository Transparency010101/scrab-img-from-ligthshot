# Scrab Img From LightShot

# What is it
if you open this link https://prnt.sc/image/4fdgjb, you can see an images of someone user.
You can some change lasts symbols, and you'll see another image(https://prnt.sc/image/afsghb), but not always.
To automatic this process I created this project on python.

# How to use
First, you have to install python3. Create virtual venv in this project and launch venv: <br>
**Linux**: `source venv/bin/activate` <br>
**Windows** `venv/Scripts/activate` <br>
then launch this command in terminal: `pip install -r requments.txt`
After installation launch this command: `python core/main.py`

First input - it's approximately count of images, which will download, why approximately? Well my program work so. <br>
Second input - it's by one time you can download several images. <br/>
Example:
    2 -> two images will download,
    3 -> three images will download

But I recommended to input max 2(you can be banned by site)
When program finished, open in this project folder img, and there will be images.

P.S Не бейте за англишь и/или русский, мне похуй.
